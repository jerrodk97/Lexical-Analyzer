The SquareGame file is needed in order to run this program. The goal is to feed the starting text file into the python code, and the code will translate the text into their lexical symbols. 
If run correctly a new file will created named cSquareGameT. 
The text is first cleaned to remove either single line comments or blocked comments and the c is added to the file name 
The output file is named to represent that it has both been cleaned and translated.
